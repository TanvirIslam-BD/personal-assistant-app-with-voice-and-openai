OpenAI
OpenAI is a research organization that aims to promote and develop friendly artificial intelligence in a way that benefits humanity as a whole. One of their key projects is GPT-3, which is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model. You will be using GPT-3 in your assistant to allow it to understand and respond to a wide range of user inputs.

IBM Watson speech libraries for embed
IBM Watson® Speech Libraries for Embed are a set of containerized text-to-speech and speech-to-text libraries designed to offer our IBM partners greater flexibility to infuse the best of IBM Research® technology into their solutions. Now available as embeddable AI, partners gain greater capabilities to build voice transcription and voice synthesis applications more quickly and deploy them in any hybrid multi-cloud environment. These technologies allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice input and output.

Voice assistants
A virtual assistant is a program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet using natural human voice. Assistants can be used in a variety of industries, including customer service, e-commerce, and education.

Python (Flask)
Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in web development and data science. Flask is a web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications. You will be using Python and Flask to build the backend of your voice assistant. Python is a powerful language that is easy to learn and has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged in projects like yours.

HTML - CSS - Javascript
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure content on the web. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. Javascript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. Together, these technologies allow us to build a visually appealing and interactive frontend for your assistant. Users will be able to interact with the voice assistant through a web interface that's built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
